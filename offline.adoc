== Introduction

The effort to minimize trust in infrastructure might imply that underlying transport mechanisms donâ€™t matter. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Anselus transport protocols have been designed to maximize privacy and prevent bad behavior. However, sometimes it is beneficial to completely avoid standard server transport.

== Offline Data Format

An offline file is even more minimalistic than a standard Anselus storage file. It is intended to convey as little information about the file except for the requirements to decrypt it. Only the key which matches the `KeyHash` field will be able to decrypt the associated payload. The hash is generated from the Base85-encoded public key used to encrypt the payload. Files using this format are expected to use the `.ejd` (**E**ncrypted **J**SON **D**ocument) file extension.

	"Item": {
		"ClientItemVersion" : "1.0",
		"KeyHash" : "BLAKE2B-256:uWpi?&AVVKIo&m;O2r=i4tKT|KJ!o~fI0|@l};li"
	},
	"Payload" : "XSALSA20:p!!IiyNgX$CYU+3Hqqb}9wng#^S^-k({8$Ou~NMjT?o6-ARS}uOcGZE1~>_2pLWQt={W1(?L)v&kT*;img18NVf|blhL*_lo-)Th@gQ`vkGy<4MS+M*`A5fI!=U+J;!l1(uhtuR_F>4);OpvDmSITh+|pDcN&i)61Y^n+SLO25gZ>4g&Au3adOrg}+kO%c#E@Db%jpN0rh}$e9Bk;7"
}

The payload of an EJD file is also JSON structured text. Multiple files may be attached. Binary data is expected to be Base85-encoded. A sample payload is listed below:

[
	{
		"Name" : "foobar.png",
		"Mimetype" : "image/png",
		"Data" : "iBL{Q4GJ0x0000DNk~Le0000A0000A2nGNE0F5%wy#N3J1am@3R0s$N2z&@+hyVZp7)eAyR2Y?G{Qv*|e+D7|6ETWL6;e+j0BM>85Q>cpXaE2J07*qoM6N<$f&"
	},
	{
		"Name" : "somehaiku.txt",
		"Mimetype" : "text/plain",
		"Data" : "Seek on high bare trails\nsky-reflecting violets\nmountain-top jewels\n"
	}
]

The payload is expected to be minified before encryption to minimize 

== Offline Message Format

Because it can contain any kind of data, an EJD file can be used to transport Anselus messages. A variation of the regular format is used for these messages, however. The only real difference is the lack of a `To`, `CC`, or `BCC` field and a different `Type` field value. This is because the user is responsible for transport and delivery of the offline message. Multiple messages may be sent using this format. Each message is its own dictionary of data fields.

To add message integrity and identity, a signature is associated with the message data. The signature may be generated with the user's Contact Request Signing Key or Primary Signing Key. The `KeyHash` field contains a hash of the Base85-encoded verification key corresponding to the signing key used. The message signature is generated from a minified version of the JSON code which includes the outside brackets. Below is an example of an EJD payload carrying an offline message.
